# Hello, 2bytes

Welcome to 2bytes.

This is a place for me [Hamid Elaosta (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/alias_neo_one) to store and share things I find of interest.

This site, unlike the previous one, is static. There is no PHP, no comment system, no wordpress, no analytics or tracking; Just a Git repository [(Github)](https://github.com/2bytes/website) and a simple web server.

I have chosen not to maintain a comment system here so feel free to contact me on Twitter or by any other means you are able to find.

I am a Software Engineer primarily, so what better way to be able to update this site than to commit my changes to git?

If you have comment, complaints, suggestions or any general feedback on the posts here I'd love to hear it.
