title = "About Me"
+++

I, [Hamid Elaosta (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/alias_neo_one) am a Software Engineer based in London, England. I studied Electronic Engineering at University and love to play with electronics projects.

Professionally I spend my time writing software, with a focus on security. My language of choice these days is [Golang](https://golang.org/), but I also spent the first half-decade of my career creating Android applications in Java, with the odd sprinkle of other platforms in C and C++ here and there.

I strongly believe in Open Source and Libre software; everything I finish goes on [my Github](https://github.com/hamid-elaosta) (Note I keep a Github organisation for things related to this site; [2bytes Github](https://github.com/2bytes)), and I'm trying to encourage myself to release more of my work there even when I feel it's not *ready* yet. 

I use Linux as my only operating system, both at home and at work, I'm always happy to discuss my reasons for that, but for now I'll just say that I first started tinkering with Linux based distros in my early teens.

Privacy and security have been an important focus for me for some time, and I intend to blog more about that. Those ideals are constant throughout my work, from why I write code that supports self-issuing your TLS certificates, to why this blog contains no analytics or cookies, and certainly, with a passion, no adverts.
