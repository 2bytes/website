# Hello, 2bytes

Welcome to the new 2bytes static site! This site will import (manually) the posts from the original 2bytes site and switch over to eventally using this one.

This new site, unlike the original, is a static site, it is created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), committed to [Github](https://github.com/2bytes/website)
and then build and deployed using an automated build task at [Werker](https://app.wercker.com)

I see the new site, and its technologies as an evolution of the original, in keeping the the development of my interests, skills and work since then.

Welcome to the https://new.2byt.es
